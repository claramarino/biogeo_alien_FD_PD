# Biogeography of alien birds
Scripts and data for reproducing the results obtained by Marino et al. in the paper "The Anthropocene biogeography of functional and phylogenetic diversities of alien birds"

## Description of the Data and file structure
Data file 00_Traits_worldwide_birds.rds contains the taxonomy and the traits of all worldwide birds (10 943 lines x 13 columns). Lines refer to species.

## How to use the scripts
The first script computes the axes of the multidimensionnal functional space based on the traits of both alien and IAS-threatened birds. The second script performs the statistical analyses based on the functional space and creates the figures 1 and 4. The third script performs the trait-by-trait analysis and creates the figured 2 and 3. The last script describes the steps implemented for evaluating the prediction of impact type based on the position of birds in the functional space.
